## ðŸ’¡ Technical Implementation Notes

### Immediate Impact Features

```typescript
// Furniture rotation support
interface FurniturePosition {
  id: string;
  x: number;
  y: number;
  size: number;
  type: FurnitureType;
  rotation?: 0 | 90 | 180 | 270; // New rotation property
  cells?: number;
}

// Auto-assignment functionality
const AutoAssignButton = () => (
  <Button onPress={autoAssignRemainingPeople}>
    Auto-assign {unassignedPeople.length} people
  </Button>
);

// Chart templates system
const useChartTemplates = () => {
  const applyTemplate = (templateId: string) => {
    const template = CHART_TEMPLATES[templateId];
    setFurniture(template.furniture);
    setAssignments(template.assignments || {});
  };
};
```

### Database Schema Additions

```sql
-- Templates table
CREATE TABLE chart_templates (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  furniture JSONB NOT NULL,
